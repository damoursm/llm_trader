"""Confidence-formula component isolation — which multiplier actually helps?

``src/signals/aggregator.py::_score_ticker`` computes the final per-ticker
confidence as a chain of multipliers on a raw base:

    raw_confidence = min(1, |combined_score| / 0.5)
    confidence     = round(min(1, raw_confidence * coherence_factor * movement_factor
                                  * volume_factor * family_factor * tape_conf_factor), 2)

Each factor was added independently over time (coherence/movement/volume first,
family + tape 2026-07-19) on the belief that it improves the signal — but the
LIVE number only ever shows the fully-blended product, so there is no way to
tell whether any ONE factor is pulling its weight, is dead weight (~neutral,
no effect either way), or is actively hurting. This module isolates each
factor: for every scored ticker (the unbiased ``signals`` panel, not just the
gate-selected trade ledger), it reconstructs what confidence WOULD have been
under "raw alone" and under "raw × exactly one factor" (never cumulatively
stacked — that's a different, harder question this module doesn't answer),
then measures whether that variant's value actually predicts the
DIRECTION-ORIENTED forward return (``sign(combined_score) × forward_return``,
the same "would following this ticker's call have worked" convention used
throughout the signals panel — see ``horizon_edge.py``'s "edge").

Two views per variant, both over the unbiased panel:

* ``compute_component_ic`` — one row per variant, Spearman IC (+ its ICIR
  reliability) at each horizon, UNGATED (every row). IC is the headline "does
  this variant discriminate good calls from bad ones" number — a variant that
  is truly inert (multiplies by ~1 everywhere, or its spread is unrelated to
  outcomes) shows IC ≈ 0. Deliberately excludes win%/return here: those never
  depend on the variant's VALUE when ungated (only IC does) — see the
  function docstring.
* ``compute_component_bands`` — the same panel split into the Low
  (0.10–0.35) / Medium (0.35–0.65) / High (0.65+) conviction bands already
  used by ``tracker._eval_stats`` for per-method calibration, applied to each
  variant's OWN value. A well-behaved component shows win%/return rising
  Low → Medium → High; a flat or inverted spread means that multiplier isn't
  actually separating good trades from bad ones despite moving the number.

The six raw ingredients (``raw_confidence`` + the five factors) are persisted
verbatim on the ``signals`` table (2026-07-21, ``SIGNAL_CONFIDENCE_COMPONENT_
COLUMNS``) rather than re-derived from other stored fields — re-deriving
``coherence_factor`` etc. from the per-method score JSON would silently apply
TODAY's formula to a HISTORICAL row (which methods were active/filtered
changes over time), corrupting the very thing being measured. This means the
dataset is FORWARD-COLLECTED from the day this shipped — old signals rows
have NULL factor columns and are excluded; judge nothing until it accrues
(same caveat as every other signals-panel analysis in this codebase).

Two applications, sharing the same variant math:

* ``compute_entry_component_report`` — every scored ticker is a hypothetical
  ENTRY, oriented by its OWN ``combined_score`` sign. "If I'd opened today
  using variant X's confidence, was it well-calibrated?"
* ``compute_exit_component_report`` — signals-panel rows that fall inside an
  ALREADY-OPEN position's holding window (``entry_date < signal_date <=
  exit_date_or_today``), oriented by the TRADE's own direction (not the
  ticker's possibly-since-drifted current call), forward return measured
  FROM the re-read tick. "If I recomputed variant X mid-hold, did a
  deteriorating reading predict trouble ahead?" No new capture path is
  needed for this — held tickers stay in the scored universe every tick
  (``pipeline.py`` folds open-trade tickers into the universe), so the
  general signals panel already has continuous rows across a hold; this
  function just joins against the ``trades`` ledger's open interval.
